# EDA-on-cardiovascular-disease-risk-prediction
In this project i am going to analyze and visualize the dataset of cardiovascular diseases risk prediction.
The dataset contains records of respondents personal lifestyle factor which consists of 7 categorical variables and 12 numerical  variables. and the aim of the project is to 
assess an individual's likelihood of developing a cardiovascular disease  based on the respondents data. 
 for the purpose of this notebook, i will be focusing on the exploratory data analysis part of this project. This is to derive insights and trends from the data.

## INSIGHTS DERIVED
### Categorical Analysis
1. The general health of respondents is very good with just 3.7% of the respondents having a poor health status.

2. The graphical display of the relationship between age category and arthritis shows respondents between the age of 50 -80+ are more prone to Arthritis

3. About 20% of the respondents are battling with depression with 13.2% being male and 6.8% female (men are more likely to be depressed than women)

### Numerical Analysis
1. I performed a correlation analysis on all numerical variables and the only strong positive correlation is between the Bod mass index and the Weight with a correlation value of 0.86.
